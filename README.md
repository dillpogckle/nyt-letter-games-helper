## NYT Letter Games Helper
NYT Letter Games Helper is a repository containing Python scripts designed to assist with solving the 
Spelling Bee and Letter Boxed games featured in the New York Times. These scripts can be executed in 
the Terminal and require user input of letters. They then provide words that can help solve the games. 
Additionally, there are plans to develop a Wordle-specific solver in the future.

### Usage
Simply clone the repository:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/dillpogckle/nyt-letter-games-helper.git 
```

Then navigate to the cloned repo and run desired script:
```shell
$ cd nyt-letter-games-helper
$ python spellingbee.py
```
or
```shell
$ python letterboxed.py
```
Note: Depending on your system configuration you may need to use **'python3'** instead of **'python'** 
on the command line. 

### Sources
The dictionary for this project was provided by github user Redbo from their scrabble repo. The link for

### Contributions
Contributions, bug reports, and feature requests are welcome! Feel free to submit a pull request or
open an issue on GitHub. I am currently working on making the Letter Boxed helper more within the
Letter Boxed game constraints.
